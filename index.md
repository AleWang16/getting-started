# PosMLab Training & Onboarding

Welcome to PoSMLab! Here you will find an introduction to our group and useful onboarding information.


## Onboarding Logistics

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Logistical details if you want to get started in PoSMLab (expand/collapse)</summary>

### General Logistics

#### MATLAB

Most of our analysis and simulation code is written in MATLAB. If you don't have MATLAB installed, please follow the [HMC Instructions for Installing MATLAB on your computer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-dmjftyCPrAWVC4g5OvJ4mv9C1jUWgiwmJVQw4iSR5w/pub)

If you are relatively new to MATLAB, a good place to start is the two-hour [MATLAB onramp](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html) course. If you're looking for some more advanced topics, you could also check out the [MATLAB ordinary differential equation course](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/R2020a/portal.html?course=odes) that is helpful for some of our simulation work, or go through this set of
[MATLAB image processing course notes](http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~zeng/Teaching/math3615/ls.pdf) that is useful for the experimental side of our research.

#### Github

We are starting to use Github to organize and collaborate on projects (even ones that aren't heavy on coding). If you haven't done so already, [create a Github account](https://github.com/join) and let Mark know your username so you can be added to the [posmlab organization on Github](https://github.com/posmlab).

If you haven't used Github before, the [Github Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) helps to step you through the actions.

*Note*: for most of our repositories we use a [Centralized Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow) and make commits directly to master. 

The Github platform uses Markdown to style text. This [Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is helpful if you're new to using Markdown.

#### Slack
We use Slack to communicate as a whole team.  (especially in the summer when we are working full time). When you are actively working on a posmlab project, try to get in the habit of logging into Slack. 

Make sure that you are added to the [posmlab Slack workspace](posmlab.slack.com).

#### Google Drive

The shared [posmlab Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HxL1mvqemhXWwuLllHtH9DN2VYXCkKgf) is a place to store large files/data. Currently its structure is in need of cleaning up.

The ["poslmab/Papers"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xL2xKtIF53JZkphJZ3PyK3RLj6TUwCBH) folder is currently where we store pdf files of relevant literature. Please add any new papers here with the naming convention of the first author last nameplace copies of relevant literature in that folder 

Number of authors | Filename Format | Example 
--------------| --------------- | -------
1 | Authorlastname Journalname Year.pdf | Doe Phys Rev Lett 2015.pdf 
2 | Firstauthorlastname and Secondauthorlastname Journalname Year.pdf | Lee and Doe Science 2018
3+ | Firstauthorlastname et al Journalname Year.pdf | Lee et al Nature 2017

Once saved in Google Drive, you can right click on the document and "Get shareable link" to provide easy access from other sources (e.g. Github repository readme file).

#### Other logistics

When starting remind Mark that he needs to:
- Enable swipe access to the Lab in Galileo B101 (he needs your Student ID Number so he can fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_ZfhmSiPN566x26YyP1rT3-csjoCd-qcJXw094bjZ1R4T4w/viewform)
- give you passwords to group accounts
- give you a lab notebook
- share access to the posmlab Google Drive Folder
- invite you to the posmlab Slack workspace 
- to add you to the posmlab Github organization (he needs your Github username to do this)

Group Accounts:

   Service     |   Name       
-------- | -------------
Gmail | physicsofsoftmatter@gmail.com
Instagram | [posm_lab](https://www.instagram.com/posm_lab/)
Squarespace (managed by Mark) | [posmlab.org](posmlab.org)
Google Drive | [posmlab shared drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HxL1mvqemhXWwuLllHtH9DN2VYXCkKgf)
Slack | [posmlab.slack.com](posmlab.slack.com)
Github | [github.com/posmlab](github.com/posmlab)


### Other (less important) off-campus logistics

#### VPN Connection 

A VPN connection to HMC is needed for remote access of lab computers, accessing journal articles online that have a paywall (and other HMC specific things too). Follow this [guide to connecting to HMC by VPN](https://docs.google.com/a/g.hmc.edu/document/d/1VpuXDPbi40UPM2APm8cxQGtQ_Dlo8ju8Yam5p2Awf74/pub).
But remember, if you don't need these specific functions, make sure you aren't connected via VPN because it will slow down your network access.

#### Accessing Lab Computers 

If you need more computational power than your personal device can handle, there are two computers in Galileo B101 connected via remote access: "Happy" and "Grumpy" (yes, all of our computers are 7 dwarf themed). 

You will need a [Remote Desktop Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients)


| Computer Name  | | IP Address  |
| ------- | --------|-------------------------| 
| Happy | |134.173.33.112 |
| Grumpy | | 134.173.33.104 |

Ask Mark for the username and passwords.

## Group Culture

To get a sense of some of the dynamics research we are doing, please watch this video on the [Rockwell Retro Encabulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w). 

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>Did you watch the video? (expand/collapse)</summary>

A common reaction to that video is going from an initial curiosity, to confusion, then finally amusement. But what does this have to do with doing research as an undergrad?

Entering a new area of research is difficult for anyone! You are about to be confronted with a lot of new information, and a lot of it you won't understand right away. That's part of the process and totally okay. 

Our group culture is one where not knowing and seeking clarification is a strength. Even questions that you feel you should know the answer to already, or seem obvious to others are important to ask. If you don't understand something, it's probably because it wasn't explained well! Here's what we ideally do in posmlab if we don't fully understand:
- ask for clarification - any question is a good question that arises from curiosity or a desire to understand!
- document our new understanding along with any sticking points for future group members 

Also note that in posmlab, Mark is a teammate/collaborator/advisor not a boss/supervisor. Openly questioning his advice is encouraged! To promote an open and equal discussion please refer to Mark on a first-name basis in our research group (rather than Prof. Ilton). 

Generally, our group culture has been one where we are supportive of one another, take interest in what others in the group are doing, and are willing to put our work aside momentarily to help someone else out!

## Introduction to PoSMLab Research 

<details open>
<summary markdown='span'>Introduction to the physics of ultra-fast elastic movements (expand/collapse)</summary>


1) [Watch this short PoSMLab Introduction video](http://youtube.com)

2) Read more [examples of ultra-fast organisms](organisms.md) that use elastic energy to drive movement. Contribute to that document by adding more information from a primary literature source for one organism (your first contribution to a posmlab Github repository!).

3) Read more [examples of engineered microrobotic devices](devices.md) inspired by nature. Contribute to that document by adding more information from a primary literature source for one device.

4) Do a careful reading of [Longo et al JEB 2019](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qVMa5j6ePS5s1gtqKgDq5B0CHeS0kLzg) which lays out a careful of Latch-mediated Spring-actuated (LaMSA) systems. Come up with three questions that you would like answered (could be clarifying questions, conceptual questions, research questions, or even just highlighting places that are confusing).

5) Watch the video [when does a spring beat a motor?](http://youtube.com).  (simple toy model example; LaMSA zone)

6) Motor model: Derive the take-off velocity for a mass $$m$$ that starts at rest and is driven by a motor that has a range of motion $$d$$ and a force-velocity trade-off $$F = F_{max}(1-v/v_{max})$$. Here $$F_{max}$$ and $$v_{max}$$ are the motor's maximum force and velocity, respectively. Do this for $$F_{max} = 20 N$$, $$v_{max} = 5 m/s$$, and $$d = 5 mm$$.
  
    Hint 1: Start with Newton's second law $$m \frac{dv}{dt} = F_{max}(1-v/v_{max})$$

    Hint 2: You should end up with a transcendental equation, so you will need to use a numerical approach. 

7) Spring model: Derive the take-off velocity for a mass $$m$$ that starts at rest and is driven by a spring of stiffness $$k$$. The spring is loaded by the same motor as the one in the "Motor model" above. 

8) Skim [Roberts and Azizi JEB 2011](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IT0M8tKtYCogp_DZB_ffbrGxaPEbItUH). What are the three main functions of biological springs? Which one are we focused on in our reserach?


    + four main determining factors for performance: (materials, geometry, size-scale, load)
    + what are max velocity (vmax), max acceleration (amax), recoil duration (deltat), max power (Pmax) as a function of k, m, ymax?
        - what if the spring has mass (ms << m vs. ms ~ m)?
    + spring load deformation: compression, tension, shear, bending, torsion
    + materials + geometry ----> k, ms (for small deformation)
    + what are vmax, amax, deltat, Pmax as a function of E, A, L, rho, epsilon for unixaxial tension?
+ recoil experiments (previous work, free vs heavy, uniaxial extension vs bending)
+ materials: measuring mechanical properties (elasticity, viscoelasticity; rheology; resilience & tan delta, loading geometry)

Modeling Subgroup
+ evolutionary biomechanics introduction (phylogeny and ontogeny; morphology, mechanical sensitivity, and tempo)
+ what can muscles really do? (intro to muscle  physiology)
+ the role of latches (control and energy mediation)
+ current state of the toy model

Materials Testing Subgroup
+ introduction to high-speed videography, digitization, and kinematic fitting
+ wave propagation in materials
+ materials selection introduction
+ mechanical batteries introduction


+ How to prepare a journal club (or rapid fire journal club)
    + Reading a paper with purpose
    + annotating
    + extracting key ideas into separate notes
    + extracting key figures


## Other Ideas


+ journal club readings (both rapid fire and full) and videos
+

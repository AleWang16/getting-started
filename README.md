# getting-started
Introduction and onboarding information for PoSMLab. 

To add to the List of Ultra-Fast Organisms, add your text to `organisms.md` using Markdown. Make sure you add your images to the `getting-started\images` folder.  

If you want to resize your images, drag your image into the URL bar to get the github url for your image (will be something like `https://github.com/posmlab/getting-started/blob/master/images/your_image.png`).
Then instead of `![](url)`, put in 
`<img src="images/your_image.png" width="500"/>`

To add to the Bioinspired Microrobotic Devices list, add your text to `devices.md` in Markdown. 

If you want a link to open in a new tab add `{:target="_blank"}` to your links. So `[check out this link](https://google.com)` opens in the same tab, while `[check out this link](https://google.com){:target="_blank"}` opens in a new tab.

# Bioinspired Microrobotic Devices

Using nature as inspiration, recent work in robotics has taken principles of design from some ultra-fast movements in nature. This page includes examples of engineered systems that (often) use the storage and quick release of elastic energy to drive movement.

To contribute to this page, choose a device from the list below and add information. Some starting references are provided as Google Drive links in each section. If you find other research papers, be sure to save them to the posmlab Google Drive "Papers" folder and link to them here. The organisms listed are from Table 1 of [Ilton et al Science 2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uo5F2MfkcKfCjjJiLNwWVN3OzWN_OLh7), but add other examples here if you come across them.

### EPFL 7 g robot 

The 7g jumping robot is capable of overcoming obstacles of around 1.4 m tall and is made to accomodate different payloads. The system has a total mass of 10 g and takes off at a 75 degree angle. To optimize the efficiency of the energy transmission from the legs, a four bar linkage design is used. In addition, this design also allows for adjustments in the take-off angle and acceleration time. Based on the mechanical properties of small jumping animals, energy is stored slowly by a DC motor into two springs connected to the legs and body and is released by a click mechanism.

### High-speed fingered hand

In the past, robots mimicking the human hand have been more focused on accuracy than speed. However, an actual human hand is more dextrous and flexible than a robotic hand because contact between fingers and the target changes dynamically. This robot makes use of high-speed vision to increase not only the accuracy, but also the speed of the "catching" mechanism.

The aim of this device was to maximize speed, acceleration, and accuracy while minimizing the weight of the device. It was determined from experimental results that 180 deg/0.1 s was sufficient speed for dynamic motion. To minimize the size of the device, only 3 fingers were used, which is sufficient for stable control. The hand has 8 total degrees of freedom, which allows it to grasp objects of various shapes. An actuator that allows high current flow in a short period of time enabled the high accelerations.

The active catching strategy has 4 phases: the approaching phase, the locking phase, the rebounding phase, and the holding phase. This strategy allows the arm to catch objects falling at a higher speed than the max. speed of the arm.

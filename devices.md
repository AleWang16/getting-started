# Bioinspired Microrobotic Devices

Using nature as inspiration, recent work in robotics has taken principles of design from some ultra-fast movements in nature. This page includes examples of engineered systems that (often) use the storage and quick release of elastic energy to drive movement.

To contribute to this page, choose a device from the list below and add information. Some starting references are provided as Google Drive links in each section. If you find other research papers, be sure to save them to the posmlab Google Drive "Papers" folder and link to them here. The organisms listed are from Table 1 of [Ilton et al Science 2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uo5F2MfkcKfCjjJiLNwWVN3OzWN_OLh7), but add other examples here if you come across them.

### EPFL 7 g robot 

The 7g jumping robot is capable of overcoming obstacles of around 1.4 m tall and is made to accomodate different payloads. The system has a total mass of 10 g and takes off at a 75 degree angle. To optimize the efficiency of the energy transmission from the legs, a four bar linkage design is used. In addition, this design also allows for adjustments in the take-off angle and acceleration time. Based on the mechanical properties of small jumping animals, energy is stored slowly by a DC motor into two springs connected to the legs and body and is released by a click mechanism.

### Flytrap-inspired robot
[Kim et al Bioinspir Biomim 2014](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13-rasGR4xlGQ_rDX6gAwDK3ehuEcGWgo)

The leaves of venus flytraps are known to have bistable properties, which means it has two stable states (see [here](https://posmlab.github.io/getting-started/organisms.html#venus-fly-trap) for more details), and researchers have used this property to create a robot that has a similar closing mechanism. The robot, pictured below, uses asymmetrically laminated sheets of carbon fiber and resin as its "leaves," which has bistability similar to that of the venus flytrap.
![Bistable Leaf](images/vft-robot-bistable-leaf.png)

The bistability of the sheets allow them to snap between the "open" and "close" states, just like how the leaves of the venus flytrap does. To activate the snap, an actuator pushes on the base of the sheets, causing the sheet to snap into its other stable, closed configuration (see below).

The "open" state has a larger radius of curvature (less curved) to make it relatively easy to snap closed. In contrast, the "closed" state has a smaller radius of curvature (more curved) to make the snapping process faster.

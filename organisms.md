# Organisms with Ultra-Fast Biomechanics

Organisms that store and release elastic energy can achieve remarkably fast movements. This page contains examples of organisms that do this, and more information about each of them. 

To contribute to this page, choose an organism from the list below and add information to organisms.md in the [posmlab Github repository](https://github.com/posmlab/getting-started). Some starting references are provided as Google Drive links in each section. If you find other research papers, be sure to save them to the posmlab Google Drive "Papers" folder and link to them here. The organisms listed are from Table 1 of [Ilton et al Science 2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uo5F2MfkcKfCjjJiLNwWVN3OzWN_OLh7), but add other examples here if you come across them.

## Hydra
#### Nematocyst Discharge

Stinging cells (nematocytes) in jellyfish, sea anemone, and hydra (all from the phylum Cnidaria) discharge their contents at extremely fast rates.  For example, [this video of many nematocysts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zJiBc_N1Zk) discharging simultaneously or [this video of a single nematocyst](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/videos/category/science/nematocyst-discharge/) discharge show what the process looks like.

High speed imaging of Hydra from 
[NÃ¼chter et al. Curr Biol 2006](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CFU_P5xovp63FzKKlri6c5yTNwNzjeBO) show this discarge can occur in 700 nanoseconds, and the stylet (barbs) accelerate at 5 million g's of acceleration:

(B) Sequence of high speed images showing this process experimentally. The nematocst is roughly 10 um in diameter, and the time between each image is 500 ns.

##### Summary of Kinematic Peformance from Nuchter et al

| Kinematic Metric | Hydra performance |
| -------- | ------- |
| Duration | 700 ns |
| Max. Velocity | 37 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 5.3 X $$10^7$$ m/s$$^2$$ | 



Wikipedia has a good description of nematocytes in the section on [Cnidocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria#Cnidocytes). The possible mechanisms  for the rapid release of energy in this system are outlined in that section as well:

> + Rapid contraction of elastic collagen-like fibers in the walls of the capsule
> + The thread acts like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released
> + Chemical changes in the capsule contents may cause them to expand rapidly by polymerization.
> + Chemical changes in the liquid in the capsule make it a much more concentrated solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it.

## Trap-jaw ant
#### Mandible strike

The mandible strike of trap-jaw ants serve as methods to avoid or eject predators and capture prey. During a mandible strike, trap-jaw ants close their mandibles at incredible speeds over short durations in specific orientations and strike surfaces to fit their desired function (avoiding predators,... ). Their common propulsion behaviors are named "bouncer defense" and "escape jump." Bouncer defense is when trap-jaw ants strike at predators while propelling themselves away. Escape jumps, on the other hand, is when trap-jaw ants strike at a substrate and vertically propel themselves to escape predation.

## Aquatic bladderworts
#### Suction trap

Aquatic bladderworts are carnivorous plants plants that use suction traps to catch small prey. Suction is created by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which releases stored elastic energy. This trapping mechanism is one of the fastest known plant movements.

The suction trapping mechanism has two stages: a slow phase, and an ultra-fast phase. In the slow phase, the internal glands pump water out of the trap. This reudces the hydrostatic pressure, which increases the elastic energy stored in the walls of the trap. Once the prey stimulates the trigger hairs on the watertight trap door, the ultra-fast phase is initiated. The door opens, causing a rush of water to flow into the trap, pulling in the prey. Then the prey is slowly broken down by a cocktail of digestive enzymes.

##### Images of the slow and ultra-fast phases of the suction trap:
![Aquatic Bladderwort Suction Trap Mechanism from Vincent et al.](images/bladderwort.png)

High speed cameras were used to image this process. The fast opening and closing of the door, with an abrupt change in shape, strongly suggests that the under-lying principle is a buckling of an elastic valve, which is triggered by the trigger hairs on the trap door. 

##### Schematic of elastic valve buckling mechanism:
![Aquatic Bladderwort Buckling Mechanism from Vincent et al.](images/bladderwort2.png)

Simulations of the mechanism show that the the stiffness of the walls of the trap must be optimized to be soft enough to deform sufficiently, but also stiff enough to overcome viscous disspation and move fast enough to catch the prey. 

The suction mechanism of these carnivorous plants is fascinating, and also useful. Since these traps are autonomously repetitive, this research the potential to inform the design of microfluidic devices that must act repeatedly.

| Kinematic Metrics | Aquatic Bladderwort performance |

| Duration | < 0.5 ms |
| Max. Fluid Velocity | 1.5 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 600g |

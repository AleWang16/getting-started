## Hydra
#### Nematocyst Discharge

Stinging cells (nematocytes) in jellyfish, sea anemone, and hydra (all from the phylum Cnidaria) discharge their contents at extremely fast rates.  For example, [this video of many nematocysts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zJiBc_N1Zk) discharging simultaneously or [this video of a single nematocyst](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/videos/category/science/nematocyst-discharge/) discharge show what the process looks like.

High speed imaging of Hydra from 
[NÃ¼chter et al. Curr Biol 2006](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CFU_P5xovp63FzKKlri6c5yTNwNzjeBO) show this discarge can occur in 700 nanoseconds, and the stylet (barbs) accelerate at 5 million g's of acceleration:

| Duration | 700 ns |
| Max. Velocity | 37 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 5.3 X $$10^7$$ m/s$$^2$$ | 



Wikipedia has a good description of nematocytes in the section on [Cnidocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria#Cnidocytes). The possible mechanisms  for the rapid release of energy in this system are outlined in that section as well:

> + Rapid contraction of elastic collagen-like fibers in the walls of the capsule
> + The thread acts like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released
> + Chemical changes in the capsule contents may cause them to expand rapidly by polymerization.
> + Chemical changes in the liquid in the capsule make it a much more concentrated solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it.

## Trap-jaw ant
#### Mandible strike

The mandible strike of trap-jaw ants serve as methods to avoid or eject predators and capture prey. During a mandible strike, trap-jaw ants close their mandibles at incredible speeds over short durations in specific orientations and strike surfaces to fit their desired function (avoiding predators,... ). Their common propulsion behaviors are named "bouncer defense" and "escape jump." Bouncer defense is when trap-jaw ants strike at predators while propelling themselves away. Escape jumps, on the other hand, is when trap-jaw ants strike at a substrate and vertically propel themselves to escape predation.

## Aquatic bladderworts
#### Suction trap

Aquatic bladderworts are carnivorous plants plants that use suction traps to catch small prey. Suction is created by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which releases stored elastic energy. This trapping mechanism is one of the fastest known plant movements.

The suction trapping mechanism has two stages: a slow phase, and an ultra-fast phase. In the slow phase, the internal glands slowly pump water out of the trap. This reudces the hydrostatic pressure, which increases the elastic energy stored in the walls of the trap. Once the prey stimulates the trigger hairs on the watertight trap door, the ultra-fast phase is initiated. The door opens, causing a rush of water to flow into the trap, pulling in the prey. Then the prey is slowly broken down by a cocktail of digestive enzymes.

##### Images of the slow and ultra-fast phases of the suction trap:
![Aquatic Bladderwort Suction Trap Mechanism from Vincent et al.](images/bladderwort.png)

High speed cameras were used to image this process. The fast opening and closing of the door, with an abrupt change in shape, strongly suggests that the under-lying principle is a buckling of an elastic valve, which is triggered by the trigger hairs on the trap door. 

##### Schematic of elastic valve buckling mechanism:
![Aquatic Bladderwort Buckling Mechanism from Vincent et al.](images/bladderwort2.png)

Simulations of the mechanism show that the the stiffness of the walls of the trap must be optimized to be soft enough to deform sufficiently, but also stiff enough to overcome viscous disspation and move fast enough to catch the prey. 

The suction mechanism of these carnivorous plants is fascinating, and also useful. Since these traps are autonomously repetitive, this research the potential to inform the design of microfluidic devices that must act repeatedly.

| Max. Fluid Velocity | 1.5 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 600g |

## Venus fly trap
#### Snap buckling

[Forterre et al Nature 2005](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18SA4m-iTxUsy19nOkHbWvtjY7VU2YxwH)

The rapid closure of venus fly traps is achieved using a method called snap buckling, where a system "snaps" from one stable state to another stable state. Here's a diagram that visualizes snap buckling.
![Snap Buckling](images/snap-buckling.png)

For reference, here is a labeled diagram of the parts of a venus fly trap.
![Parts of a Venus Fly Trap](images/venus-fly-trap-labeled.jpg)

In the open state, the lobes of the venus fly trap are convex (when viewed from the inside), while in the closed state, the lobes are concave.
![Closed and Open Venus Fly Traps](images/venus-fly-traps.jpg)

When the venus fly trap goes from the open state to the closed state, the lobes undergo snap buckling from convex to concave. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhVKVSkdedY) showing it close up.

The snap closure of venus fly traps usually occur in less than half of a second, though the snap time varies from about 0.2 to 0.8 seconds. Since venus fly traps are also found to grow underwater, researchers timed the closing of submerged venus fly traps, and found that the closing time underwater was not significantly different from the closing time on land.
![Closing Times in Different Mediums](images/venus-fly-traps-closing-times.png)

Additionally, tests involving ink droplets in the water showed that there was no significant outflow of water upon closure, meaning that venus fly traps could effectively catch underwater organisms without failing due to water being forced out, though this has yet to be studied in depth.

## Chameleon
#### Ballistic Tongue Projection
Chameleons project their tongues up to 2 times their body length in order to capture prey. Especially in smaller species, their tongue projection has evolved in order to minimize energy loss and maximize the efficiency of the feeding apparatus. Variation in tongue length, body length, and most notably snout-vent length (distance between cloaca and where the jaw joins, the jaw symphysis), result in the variations in tongue mechanism function. The tongue quick projection and retraction is acheived by 2 muscles, the accerlator muscle and the hyoglossus that are activated sequentially, as the tongue folds in an accordion-like manner.

##### Summary of Kinematic Peformance from Anderson

The kinematic performance of the chameleon tongue mechanism varies between species, with smaller species demonstrating the shortest durations, and highest accelerations and power outputs. The max. velocity acheived is proportional between species. Data was scaled by SVL, or snout-vent length of the species. 

| Kinematic Metric | Chameleon Tongue Performance |
| -------- | ------- |
| Duration | 9.7 - 54.6 ms |
| Max. Velocity | 2.91 - 5.41 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 286 - 2,590 m/s$$^2$$ | 
| Max. Power Output | 1410 - 14040 W/kg |

# PosMLab Training & Onboarding

## Logistics


### Working from off-campus

[Guide to connecting to HMC by VPN](https://docs.google.com/a/g.hmc.edu/document/d/1VpuXDPbi40UPM2APm8cxQGtQ_Dlo8ju8Yam5p2Awf74/pub)

VPN is needed for remote access of lab computers, accessing journal articles online that have a paywall (and other things too).

[Remote Desktop Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients)

Lab Computers with Remote Access:
134.173.33.112 (Happy)
134.173.33.104 (Grumpy)

Ask Mark for username and password.

### General Logistics

Create Github account and let Mark know your username.

Ask Mark for:
- Swipe access to the Lab Galileo B101 (need your Student ID Number)
- passwords to accounts
- lab notebook
- access to posmlab Google Drive Folder
- access to posmlab Slack workspace 
- to be added to the posmlab Github organization (need your Github username)

Group Accounts:
physicsofsoftmatter@gmail.com
https://www.instagram.com/posm_lab/
posmlab.org (Squarespace account managed by Mark)

Use Github and Markdown https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet


## Group Culture
[Rockwell Retro Encabulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w)

Entering a new area of research is difficult! 

If you don't understand something, it's probably because it wasn't explained well!
- ask for clarification: any question is a good question that arises from curiosity or a desire to understand!
- document your new understanding for future group members

Mark is a teammate/collaborator/advisor not a boss/supervisor. Openly questioning his advice is encouraged! To promote an open and equal discussion please refer to Mark on a first-name basis in our research group (rather than Prof. Ilton). 

Generally, our group culture has been one where we are supportive of one another, take interest in what others in the group are doing, and are willing to put our work aside momentarily to help someone else out!


## Topics for Training
+ [Inspiration from Nature](organisms.md)
+ [Engineering examples](devices.md)
+ LaMSA systems
    + Discussion of [Longo et al JEB 2019](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qVMa5j6ePS5s1gtqKgDq5B0CHeS0kLzg) including definitions and examples of motor spring latch load
+ when does a spring beat a motor? (simple toy model example; LaMSA zone)
+ what can springs do? 
    + roles of springs in biology: [Roberts and Azizi JEB 2011](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IT0M8tKtYCogp_DZB_ffbrGxaPEbItUH)
    + four main determining factors for performance: (materials, geometry, size-scale, load)
    + what are max velocity (vmax), max acceleration (amax), recoil duration (deltat), max power (Pmax) as a function of k, m, ymax?
        - what if the spring has mass (ms << m vs. ms ~ m)?
    + spring load deformation: compression, tension, shear, bending, torsion
    + materials + geometry ----> k, ms (for small deformation)
    + what are vmax, amax, deltat, Pmax as a function of E, A, L, rho, epsilon for unixaxial tension?
+ recoil experiments (previous work, free vs heavy, uniaxial extension vs bending)
+ materials: measuring mechanical properties (elasticity, viscoelasticity; rheology; resilience & tan delta, loading geometry)

Modeling Subgroup
+ evolutionary biomechanics introduction (phylogeny and ontogeny; morphology, mechanical sensitivity, and tempo)
+ what can muscles really do? (intro to muscle  physiology)
+ the role of latches (control and energy mediation)
+ current state of the toy model

Materials Testing Subgroup
+ introduction to high-speed videography, digitization, and kinematic fitting
+ wave propagation in materials
+ materials selection introduction
+ mechanical batteries introduction

+ Organizational structure (Github, Google Drive, physicsofsoftmatter@gmail.com, Slack, Instagram account, Lab Space, Computing (lab computers), MATLAB libraries).

+ How to prepare a journal club (or rapid fire journal club)
    + Reading a paper with purpose
    + annotating
    + extracting key ideas into separate notes
    + extracting key figures


## Other Ideas


+ journal club readings (both rapid fire and full) and videos
+ 

## To Do (MI)

- [ ] make sample JC presentation
- [ ] outline goals and first steps for each project
- [ ] populate each repository with initial uploads and README.md summarizing the contents
- [ ]

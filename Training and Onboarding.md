# PosMLab Training & Onboarding


## Topics for Training
+ [Inspiration from Nature](organisms.md))
+ [Engineering examples](devices.md)
+ LaMSA systems
    + Discussion of [Longo et al JEB 2019](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qVMa5j6ePS5s1gtqKgDq5B0CHeS0kLzg) including definitions and examples of motor spring latch load
+ when does a spring beat a motor? (simple toy model example; LaMSA zone)
+ what can springs do? 
    + roles of springs in biology: [Roberts and Azizi JEB 2011](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IT0M8tKtYCogp_DZB_ffbrGxaPEbItUH)
    + four main determining factors for performance: (materials, geometry, size-scale, load)
    + what are max velocity (vmax), max acceleration (amax), recoil duration (deltat), max power (Pmax) as a function of k, m, ymax?
        - what if the spring has mass (ms << m vs. ms ~ m)?
    + spring load deformation: compression, tension, shear, bending, torsion
    + materials + geometry ----> k, ms (for small deformation)
    + what are vmax, amax, deltat, Pmax as a function of E, A, L, rho, epsilon for unixaxial tension?
+ recoil experiments (previous work, free vs heavy, uniaxial extension vs bending)
+ materials: measuring mechanical properties (elasticity, viscoelasticity; rheology; resilience & tan delta, loading geometry)

Modeling Subgroup
+ evolutionary biomechanics introduction (phylogeny and ontogeny; morphology, mechanical sensitivity, and tempo)
+ what can muscles really do? (intro to muscle  physiology)
+ the role of latches (control and energy mediation)
+ current state of the toy model

Materials Testing Subgroup
+ introduction to high-speed videography, digitization, and kinematic fitting
+ wave propagation in materials
+ materials selection introduction
+ mechanical batteries introduction

+ Organizational structure (Github, Google Drive, physicsofsoftmatter@gmail.com, Slack, Instagram account, Lab Space, Computing (lab computers), MATLAB libraries).

+ How to prepare a journal club (or rapid fire journal club)
    + Reading a paper with purpose
    + annotating
    + extracting key ideas into separate notes
    + extracting key figures


## Other Ideas


+ journal club readings (both rapid fire and full) and videos
+ 

## To Do (MI)

- [ ] make sample JC presentation
- [ ] outline goals and first steps for each project
- [ ] populate each repository with initial uploads and README.md summarizing the contents
- [ ]

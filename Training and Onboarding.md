# PosMLab Training & Onboarding


## Topics for Training
+ Inspiration from Nature (start with [organisms.md](organisms.md))

+ LaMSA systems [Longo et al JEB 2019](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qVMa5j6ePS5s1gtqKgDq5B0CHeS0kLzg) (bio and eng examples [jumper examples including CMU robot, deep dive of TJA and mantis shrimp], definitions and types of motor spring latch load)
+ when does a spring beat a motor? (simple toy model example; LaMSA zone)
+ what can muscles do? (intro to muscle  physiology)
+ what can springs do? (materials, geometry, size-scale, load)
+ introduction to high-speed videography, digitization, and kinematic fitting
+ materials: measuring mechanical properties (elasticity, viscoelasticity; rheology; resilience & tan delta, loading geometry)
+ wave propagation in materials
+ evolutionary biomechanics introduction (phylogeny and ontogeny; morphology, mechanical sensitivity, and tempo)
+ recoil experiments (previous work, free vs heavy, uniaxial extension vs bending)
+ materials selection introduction
+ mechanical batteries introduction
+ the role of latches (control and energy mediation)

+ Organizational structure (Github, Google Drive, physicsofsoftmatter@gmail.com, Slack, Instagram account, Lab Space, Computing (lab computers), MATLAB libraries).

+ How to prepare a journal club (or rapid fire journal club)
    + Reading a paper with purpose
    + annotating
    + extracting key ideas into separate notes
    + extracting key figures


## Other Ideas


+ journal club readings (both rapid fire and full) and videos
+ 

## To Do (MI)

- [ ] make sample JC presentation
- [ ] outline goals and first steps for each project
- [ ] populate each repository with initial uploads and README.md summarizing the contents
- [ ]
